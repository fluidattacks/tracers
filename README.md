## Key Features

- Allows you to instrument any **function** or **statement**
  on **your own code** or any **third party library**
- Handles [**asynchronous**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) code
  **out-of-the box**, no config required
- Exposes a **high-level API**:
  - A decorator: `@trace`, to instrument functions
    - Example:
      ```
      @trace
      def any_function(*args, **kwargs):
          pass

      @trace
      async def other_function(*args, **kwargs):
          pass
      ```
  - A function: `call` to instrument code in-line
    - Example:
      ```
      call(any_function, *args, **kwargs)
      await call(other_function, *args, **kwargs)
      ```
  - Sync/async cases are handled internally
  - `call` and `@trace` are equivalent, you can choose the one that fits you best
- It's **Thread-safe**, **Async-safe**, **Process-safe** and **Context-safe**
  - You'll get accurate results in any scenario
- Introduces **minimal overhead** and it's **easy to deploy**!
  - It's a pure python implementation based on
   [contextvars](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html) and
   [decorators](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-decorator).
   Your code runs as fast as if you were not profiling it
- It's easy to pin-point performance problems:
  - Gives you the total execution time in seconds and **%**
  - Allows you to identify points in time where your **async** event loop got blocked
- Made with love by nerds, for humans :heart:

# Quick Introduction

Let's start with a very basic example:

```py
import time
from dateutil.parser import parse


def example():
    time.sleep(2.0)
    your_business_logic('Sat Oct 11')


def your_business_logic(date: str):
    parse(date)
    time.sleep(1.0)


example()
```

Tracing its flow and gathering profiling information is a matter of
decorating your functions:

```diff
--- a/examples/without_tracers.py
+++ b/examples/with_tracers.py
@@ -1,15 +1,18 @@
 import time
 from dateutil.parser import parse
+from tracers.function import trace


+@trace()
 def example():
     time.sleep(2.0)
     your_business_logic('Sat Oct 11')


+@trace()
 def your_business_logic(date: str):
     parse(date)
     time.sleep(1.0)


 example()
```

If you run it, all the functions you decorated will be traced
and you'll have metrics of the execution flow:

```

     # Timestamp                Net              Total    Call Chain

     1     0.00s     2.00s [ 66.7%]     3.00s [100.0%]    âœ“ example
     2     2.00s     1.00s [ 33.3%]     1.00s [ 33.3%]    Â¦   âœ“ your_business_logic

           Count                Net              Total    Function

               1     2.00s [ 66.7%]     3.00s [100.0%]    âœ“ example
               1     1.00s [ 33.3%]     1.00s [ 33.3%]    âœ“ your_business_logic
```

From the output you can conclude:
- executing function *example* took a total of *3.0* seconds to complete
- function *example* takes *66.7%* of the execution time
- function *example encloses *100%* of your code time
- function *example* called function: *your_business_logic*
- function *your_business_logic* took *1.0* seconds out of the *3.0* seconds
  the function *example* needed to complete
- function *your_business_logic* represents *33.3%* of your execution time

Tracing code is not limited to your own code.
You can trace any **callable object** including **third party packages**,
**Python's standard library**, and almost anything

The level of detail is up to you!
